This component is responsible for provisioning Datadog Log Archives. It creates a single log archive pipeline for each
AWS account. If the `catchall` flag is set, it creates a catchall archive within the same S3 bucket.

Each log archive filters for the tag `env:$env` where $env is the environment/account name (ie sbx, prd, tools, etc), as
well as any tags identified in the additional_tags key. The `catchall` archive, as the name implies, filters for '\*'.

A second bucket is created for cloudtrail, and a cloudtrail is configured to monitor the log archive bucket and log
activity to the cloudtrail bucket. To forward these cloudtrail logs to datadog, the cloudtrail bucket's id must be added
to the s3_buckets key for our datadog-lambda-forwarder component.

Both buckets support object lock, with overridable defaults of COMPLIANCE mode with a duration of 7 days.

## Prerequisites

- Datadog integration set up in target environment
  - We rely on the datadog api and app keys added by our datadog integration component

## Issues, Gotchas, Good-to-Knows

### Destroy/reprovision process

Because of the protections for S3 buckets, if we want to destroy/replace our bucket, we need to do so in two passes or
destroy the bucket manually and then use terraform to clean up the rest. If reprovisioning a recently provisioned
bucket, the two-pass process works well. If the bucket has a full day or more of logs, though, deleting it manually
first will avoid terraform timeouts, and then the terraform process can be used to clean up everything else.

#### Two step process to destroy via terraform

- first set `s3_force_destroy` var to true and apply
- next set `enabled` to false and apply or use tf destroy

## Usage

**Stack Level**: Global

Here's an example snippet for how to use this component. It's suggested to apply this component to all accounts from
which Datadog receives logs.

```yaml
components:
  terraform:
    datadog-logs-archive:
      settings:
        spacelift:
          workspace_enabled: true
      vars:
        enabled: true
  #       additional_query_tags:
  #         - "forwardername:*-dev-datadog-lambda-forwarder-logs"
  #         - "account:123456789012"
```
